# 2. Combinational Logic Optimization

In this subdivision, we focused on **combinational logic optimization**.  
We mainly worked with the **OPT files** (`OPT-check.v`, `OPT-check2.v`, `OPT-check3.v`, `OPT-check4.v`, etc.), along with their corresponding **relog files**.  

The main idea was to perform **constant propagation** and simplify the designs into basic logic gates.  

---

## Files Overview

- **OPT-check.v** → Simplifies into an **AND gate**  
- **OPT-check2.v** → Simplifies into an **OR gate**  
- **OPT-check3.v** → Simplifies into a **3-input AND gate**  
- **OPT-check4.v** → Used for **Lab Experiment 1**  
- **multiple_module_OPT.v** → Used for **Lab Experiment 2**

We also learned about **multiple modules** in `multiple_module_OPT.v` where different blocks are optimized individually.

---

## Command for Constant Propagation

Before running ABC mapping, we must perform constant propagation with:

```bash
opt_clean -purge
stat
```
- This ensures redundant constants are removed and optimization happens properly.
- stat will provide statistics

  - as the verilog code shows its a multiplexer the synthesizer optimized it into an AND gate.

## Key Learning

- Combinational optimization is achieved using constant propagation.
- `opt_clean -purge` is mandatory before `abc -liberty` command for proper optimization.
- Complex-looking Verilog simplifies into basic logic gates after optimization.
- Multiple modules can be optimized separately, reducing redundancy.
