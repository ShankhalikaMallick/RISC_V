# 3. Sequential Logic Optimization

In this subdivision, I focused on **sequential logic optimization**.  
I analyzed and synthesized several **D flip-flop (dff)** based modules with constant inputs, observing how the synthesis tool optimizes redundant logic.

---

##  What I Learned

- Sequential constant propagation is very effective in removing redundant flip-flops when outputs are constant.  
- Synthesis tools can optimize DFF-based modules into simpler logic (like wires) if possible, saving area.  
- Observing synthesis statistics and graphical representation helps me understand how the tool interprets my RTL.  
- Understanding sequential optimization helps me write **more efficient RTL** for state machines and memory elements.

##  dff_const1

- **Observation:** Standard DFF; output depends on input.  
- Synthesizer prints DFFs correctly.  

- **Key Learnings:**  
  - Confirms correct mapping of flip-flops.  
  - Useful for sequential logic verification.

  ![Synthesis Stats](.Screenshots/dff_const1_synth.jpg)  

  - Here there is no possiblity of optimizing the design hence 1 DFF is used.

##  dff_const2

- **Observation:** Output is **always 1** regardless of inputs or reset.  
- Synthesizer optimized logic into a **wire**, no DFFs printed.  

- **Key Learnings:**  
  - Sequential constant propagation removes redundant flip-flops.  
  - Recognizing constant outputs helps simplify the design.

  ![Synthesis Stats](.Screenshots/dff_const2_synth.jpg) 

  - Here the DFF is always logic 1 **independent of input and reset** . Hence DFF is optimized into a logic 1 wire.

##  dff_const3

- **Observation:** Similar to const2; constant output optimized.  
- Synthesizer reduces redundant flip-flops.  

- **Key Learnings:**  
  - Constant outputs in sequential circuits can be optimized to **wires**.  
  - Helps save area and reduce unnecessary hardware.  

- **Screenshot: Verilog Module**  

  ![Verilog Screenshot](.Screenshots/dff_const3_verilog.jpg)  

  - The design can't be optimized. Hence the design requires 2 Flip Flops.

- **Screenshot: Synthesis Statistics**  

  ![Synthesis Stats](.Screenshots/dff_const3_synth.jpg)  
   
  - Hence the printing statistics proved that the design can't be optimized.
  - It printed 2 Flip Flops.

##  Lab Experiments

###  Lab 1 – dff_const4

- Performed analysis and synthesis for sequential optimization.  
- Redundant flip-flops removed wherever possible.  

- **Screenshot: Verilog Module**  

  ![Verilog Screenshot](.Screenshots/dff_const4_verilog.jpg) 

  - In this module, irrespective of the clock and Reset the output `q` and `q1` will stay at logic 1.
  - Hence we don't need any flip flops to store. Just logic 1 wire is enough.

---

- **Screenshot: Synthesis Statistics**  

  ![Synthesis Stats](.Screenshots/dff_const4_synth.jpg) 

  - The synthesis stats proved no hardware (FF) is needed. 
  - Hence the design was optimized by the synthesizer (Yosys).

###  Lab 2 – dff_const5

- Similar analysis and optimization as const4.  

- **Screenshot: Verilog Module**  

  ![Verilog Screenshot](.Screenshots/dff_const5_verilog.jpg)  

  - From the module, it is clearly seen that the design can't be optimized.
  - when the reset is applied, both the outputs `q1` and `q` becomes 0. 
  - If reset is 0 , both the outputs `q1` and `q` becomes 1.
  - So we need 2 flip flops to store the output.

- **Screenshot: Synthesis Statistics**  

  ![Synthesis Stats](.Screenshots/dff_const5_synth.jpg)

  - Yes, our synthesizer also proved that 2 flops is enough for this design.
  - Hence, no optimizations were made.
