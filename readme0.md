This repository documents the work done in **Week 0** of my **RISC-V SoC Tapeout project**

---

## 🖥️ Program Overview
The **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program** is a 20-week hands-on project that guides students through the process of designing, simulating, and preparing a **RISC-V System-on-Chip (SoC)** for tapeout.  
The program focuses on:  
- Understanding **digital VLSI design** concepts.  
- Learning to use **EDA tools** like **Icarus Verilog, GTKWave, Yosys, OpenLane and Openroad etc.**.  
- Building foundational knowledge for **ASIC design flows** and **chip verification**.  
- Developing a step-by-step approach to **document, implement, and test a mini SoC**.  

This repository captures **Week 0 tasks**, including learning summaries and tool installations.
