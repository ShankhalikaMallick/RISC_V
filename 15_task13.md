# 4. Sequential Optimization for Unused Outputs

- In this subdivision, I focused on **unused output optimization** in sequential circuits.  
- I analyzed a **counter module** to observe how synthesis tools optimize unused flip-flop outputs.

---

##  File Analyzed

- **counter_opt.v** – 3-bit counter used for analysis.

I performed **Verilog simulation**, **code analysis**, and **synthesis**, and studied the graphical representation to understand how unused outputs are handled.

### Case 1 – Only LSB Used

- **Observation:**  
  - The counter’s output depends **only on the LSB (count_0)**.  
  - The MSB bits are **unused**.  
  - Synthesizer optimized the design to a **single flip-flop with an inverter**, removing the redundant MSB flip-flops.  

- **Key Learnings:**  
  - Sequential optimization can remove unused outputs, saving area and reducing power.  
  - Even if a module has multiple flip-flops, only the **essential logic** is retained after optimization.

  - In this code the output `q` depends only on lsb (count[0]) but not first 2 bits.

- Here the need for 3 flip flops is reduced into 1 flop and an inverter.
- so the unused outputs is optimized.

### Case 2 – All Outputs Used

- **Observation:**  
  - The counter output is **100**, meaning all three flip-flops are utilized.  
  - Synthesizer **did not perform any optimization** since all outputs are necessary.  

- **Key Learnings:**  
  - Unused output optimization only occurs when certain outputs are redundant or unconnected.  
  - Tools retain all flip-flops if all outputs are functional and necessary.

     - Here the ouput `q` depends only on all the 3 bits.

- Here 3 flip flops are used and no optimizations can be done.
- Hence this design can't be optimized by the synthesizer.

##  Overall Key Learning from This Subdivision

- Sequential optimization tools can **detect unused outputs** and remove redundant flip-flops.  
- Optimizing unused outputs reduces **area, power, and routing congestion**.  
- It’s important to identify which outputs are actually used in your design to help the synthesis tool optimize efficiently.
